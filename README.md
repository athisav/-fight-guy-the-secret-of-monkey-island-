IF THIS DOESN'T WORK OUT WE ARE MAKING A DOOM COPYCAT

"game ideas / environment"
breakable crates

"game ideas / detailed mechanics"
infinite ammo but reload.
combos possible like in smash but with guns
eg grenade launcher that has knockback

grab --> enemy has to mash to escape; grabber can toss in a direction; toss into wall --> stuns for time depending on speed of player as they are tossed into wall
dash for speed boost; speed quickly drops off; small cooldown; can store up to 2 dashes
hit by kb --> cant act for small time frame; time scales to amount of kb

player immune to stuns for 2s after being stunned (timer starts when stun ends)

shielding exactly like in smash but doesnt get smaller; changes color from blue to red to indicate strength

weapons (player chooses 1 of each type at beginning of match; 2 main weapons allowed; counterpicks in competitive)

-----main hand------
grenade launcher (high kb. can charge to fire longer distance. explodes after [] seconds or if contact with enemy)

rocket launcher (low kb. can charge for faster rocket)

katana (no kb. small cd. medium damage. first hit stuns for 0.5s; recharges stun in 3.5s. can charge attacks for higher damage. katana slice hits katana slice --> clang and neither player takes damage; player that attacked last has no lag while other is stunned)

power gauntlet (very high kb; high dmg; medium cd)

uzi (no kb, small spread)

-----secondary------
C4 (medium kb. max 1 out at once)

shotgun (low kb, low damage, medium spread, high damage to shield)

railgun (no kb. must be charged like cloud's down-b. player takes 2x dmg while charging)

-----utility------
hook (roadhog lol. high cd. medium range. stuns for 0.5s)

paralyzer (medium speed. high cd. stuns for 1.5s)

blink device (instant tp to wherever aimed; reuires line of sight. cannot attack for 0.5s after tp)'''
ults (charge with damage dealt and taken; damage dealt charges 3x faster than taken; reverse is true for juggernaut) 
juggernaut (no kb taken; 0.5x damage taken; instantly reload all weapons)
frenzy (deal 1.5x damage; instantly reload all)
haste (2x dash recharge speed; dash limit increases to 4; instantly refill dashes)

------------------------------------------
Multiplayer random seed

clients connect to server for matchmaking
--> matchmaking matches clients up
--> server sends master seed to all clients in same room
--> master seed used for all Random instances in every script (make sure seed is set BEFORE anything random is done)
-----------------------------------------
Plan
1. Map generation (crates - collision - destructible)(explosive crates)
2. Standard mechanics (standard gun - UZI)(taking damage)
2. Multiplayer
3. Detailed mechanics
4. Animation/controls 
5. In-game GUI
6. Main Menu GUI
7. Polish up
